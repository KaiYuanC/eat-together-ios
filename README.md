# About Eat2Gether
Eat2Gether is an app that allows users to remotely decide upon a restaurant, from which they can order through a delivery or take-out of their choice and ‘dine together’ in a virtual capacity. Hopefully, beyond the pandemic, it can also be used to come to a consensus when a group can’t decide what to eat (decisions are hard sometimes!)

It asks for preferences such as price point, cuisine type, and dietary restrictions. We take the location of every user in the room and determine a central point between everyone to make sure that we’re recommending a good location for everyone. After we get all our user preferences and locations, we process the search through the Google Places API in our node back-end and save the results to our database.
